# Torre de Hanoi - THE GAME ###

A game made in C with Allegro  for the class of "Algorithms and programming" of Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM)

This game was developed in the first half of 2018, when I had a simple knowledge about the C programming language.

The graphical interface was developed on Photoshop.

It wasn't optimized after that!

##### This game was not finished fully, but it's playable!

This game uses Allegro library. You can find Allegro on https://liballeg.org/
I used CodeBlocks IDE to develop that. You can find CodeBlocks IDE on http://www.codeblocks.org/
But you can use the IDE of your choice.
